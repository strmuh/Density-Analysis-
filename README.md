### General Info
***
Gaining insight into engineering material behaviours and properties has become highly dependent on microscopy analysis
in the modern world.
While obtaining high-quality micrographs is a challenge in itself, a common difficulty is processing and analysing the
data thereafer. The purpose of this project is to automate the analysis of light-microscopy images of alloys and produce
a calculated value for phase/void density based on pixel density.     

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Version 0.25.3 
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): Version 1.18.1
